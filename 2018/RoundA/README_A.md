## Round A
### Even Digits

Struggled a bit with finding next number due to minor erros.

Studied Kuang Bin's code available on NowCoder.com href = `https://www.nowcoder.com/courses/1041/2/1`

Obviously learned to handle digits in int[] array format

Also learned to write clear code if possible

### Lucky Dip

Have seens this problem before, good to see the analysis part for binary search apporach.

Here I write both apporaches, commented out the normal `O[N*K]` approach
